The file crypto_lstm.h5 is a binary file that contains the saved LSTM model, including both the architecture and the weights. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. You should ensure that the model is saved correctly from your training script, and this file will be generated automatically when you run that script.

If you need to create this file, please run your training script (train.py) which saves the model as "crypto_lstm.h5".
