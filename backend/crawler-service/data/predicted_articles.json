    "title": "Bitcoin - Ready for a new all time high! + ALT SEASON starting",
    "content": [
      "Bitcoin is breaking out of the symmetrical triangle and showing major signs of strength, so we can expect to hit a new all-time high in the short term! Bitcoin was struggling in the past weeks compared to the stock market, but this should end!Why do I think that the alt season is starting? To answer this question, we need to look at the BTC.D (Bitcoin dominance chart). if BTC.D goes up, that means money is flowing out of altcoins to Bitcoin, and when BTC.D goes down, that means money is flowing from Bitcoin to altcoins. And we want BTC.D to go up! So what is the chart telling us?First of all, this is not exactly BTC.D on TradingView, but this is BTCDOMUSDT.P. I think this chart may give us a better outlook on the dominance at the moment. So what we can see here is that the long-term trendline is breaking down, that's a pretty rare event.That's definitely great news! Time to buy some altcoins and prepare for a bullish altcoin season. I would say forget about Bitcoin and a 5% profit; let's buy some altcoins, and I want you to tell me in the comment section, what altcoin do you believe in?Write a comment with your altcoin + hit the like button, and I will make an analysis for you in response. Trading is not hard if you have a good coach! This is not a trade setup, as there is no stop-loss or profit target. I share my trades privately. Thank you, and I wish you successful trades!Trading tip at the end: Learn to bear losses - A trader needs to accept the losses to maintain their emotional stability. Losses are a crucial internal part of trading that helps traders to learn how to grow from their losses. Traders learn from losses and implement required changes in their strategies for better results in future trades."

    "content": [
      "Hey Everyone,Please see update on our 4H Chart route map, also playing out perfectly with our levels being respected, as analysed.We have our bearish target hit at 3295 and currently testing for support and bounce. Ema5 cross and lock below this level will open the swing range and failure to lock will see price reject and head up for the Bullish target. The 1h chart route map from yesterdays update also has the swing range open, which we need to keep in mind when planning to buy dips.We will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch bounces up.We will continue to buy dips using our support levels taking 20 to 40 pips. As stated before each of our level structures give 20 to 40 pip bounces, which is enough for a nice entry and exit. If you back test the levels we shared every week for the past 24 months, you can see how effectively they were used to trade with or against short/mid term swings and trends.The swing range give bigger bounces then our weighted levels that's the difference between weighted levels and swing ranges.BULLISH TARGET3364EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3364 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGETS3429EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3429 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET3499EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3429 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET3499EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3499 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET3561BEARISH TARGETS3295 - DONEEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 3295 WILL OPEN THE SWING RANGE32423171EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 3171 WILL OPEN THE SECONDARY SWING RANGE30893001As always, we will keep you all updated with regular updates throughout the week and how we manage the active ideas and setups.

      "End of day update from us here at KOG:Today was another choppy day on gold with price accumulating in a small range before the break out.  We had the bullish above and bearish below level so no choice but to wait for the break.  Ultimately, 3320 broke on the 15min indi and then we managed to complete all of our bearish targets for the day.  Well worth the wait!Now we have support below at the 3285 level with resistance sitting at 3310 which is the level that will need to hold us down to target lower.  Lower first, which would be ideal, we may get a RIP over the session to come.RED BOX TARGETS:Break above 3350 for 3355, 3360, 3362, 3365, 3374, 3388 and 3396 in extension of the moveBreak below 3335 for 3331‚úÖ, 3324‚úÖ, 3321‚úÖ, 3310‚úÖ, 3306‚úÖ and 3293‚úÖ in extension of the moveTodays levels from Camelot:Price: 3324RED BOXES:Break above 3336 for 3340, 3346, 3350 and 3360 in extension of the moveBreak below 3320 for 3310‚úÖ, 3306‚úÖ, 3304‚úÖ and 3297‚úÖ in extension of the moveAs always, trade safe.KOG",

      "The NAS100 is currently coiling within a tight consolidation range, showing signs of tension building up. After a strong push upward, price has been moving sideways in a narrowing structure. This build-up around the high, a compression of buyers and sellers in a low-volatility squeeze could be an indication that we could use. This kind of price action typically signals that buyers are gaining control, squeezing out sellers with each dip.The lack of deep pullbacks combined with increasingly shallow sell-offs shows fading bearish momentum. Which is often typical during a buildup phase before a breakout. If buyers can push price above with a strong close, it could trigger breakout momentum and lead to a continuation of the larger bullish trend.Ideally, if price reacts positively and forms bullish confirmation, it would set up a solid continuation entry, with upside potential toward the next target of 23.400.Until then, bulls are watching closely for signs of commitment. The breakout is yet to be confirmed, but the squeeze is on, and the pressure is building.What will happen next?Just sharing my thoughts for the charts, this isn‚Äôt financial advice.

The news supported the dollar and weakened demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.Although uncertainty remains around U.S. trade negotiations ahead of the July 9 tariff deadline, signals of possible extensions and staggered implementation have further reduced short-term haven flows into gold.Technical View:Gold remains under bearish pressure while trading below 3320.As long as the price stays under this level, we expect sideways consolidation between 3297 and 3320 until a breakout occurs.A 1H close below 3297 would confirm bearish continuation, targeting 3281 and 3255.A break above 3320 would invalidate the bearish outlook and shift momentum toward 3342.Pivot: 3297Support Levels: 3281 / 3255 / 3239Resistance Levels: 3314 / 3320 / 3342Previous idea:Click Here...",
      "GOLDNew UpdateExtended Bearish Move: +280 pip‚úÖGold continued its decline after a confirmed 1H candle close below 3297, reaching 3287 as expected. The trend remains bearish, with the next target at 3281.‚ö†Ô∏è A 15-minute close above 3297 would be a sensitive zone and could lead to choppy movement or a short-term reversal.Current Range: 3297 ‚Äì 3281‚ö†Ô∏è The market will move under the tariff situation",
      "GOLD ‚Äì Technical OutlookGold dropped and precisely reached our bearish target at 3282, confirming the bearish setup.The metal remains under bearish pressure as long as it trades below 3297 on the 4H timeframe.While below this level, the bearish trend is expected to continue, targeting 3281.A confirmed 1H or 15M close below 3281 would open the path toward 3270 and 3255.On the other hand, a 1H or 4H close above 3297 would signal bullish sensitivity, potentially shifting momentum to the upside.Key LevelsPivot: 3297Support: 3282 / 3271 / 3256Resistance: 3307 / 3320"

      "In yesterday‚Äôs analysis, I mentioned that due to Monday‚Äôs daily Pin Bar, I closed my short trade on Gold around break-even and decided to wait for more confirmation.Unfortunately, that wasn't the best decision. The price failed to break above resistance for a bullish continuation and instead dropped sharply, closing the day exactly at the 3300 figure. At the time of writing, Gold is trading even lower at 3293, after briefly rebounding from the 3285 support zone‚Äîa level I‚Äôve highlighted in the past.Moving forward, after the failed bullish continuation and yesterday‚Äôs bearish move, it‚Äôs clear that bears are back in control. A drop toward the 3250 zone is now on the table.Conclusion:I‚Äôm looking to sell rallies, with my invalidation zone set above 3340, aiming for a good risk-to-reward setup.Disclosure: I am part of TradeNation's Influencer program and receive a monthly fee for using their TradingView charts in my analyses and educational articles."

    "content": [
      "Hey whats up traders, in reveal cheat code for day trading by using session profiles. It's powerful concept. If correctly applied with HTF trend it will allows you to join running train path the right time.Dont forget to follow me. I release such articles every Monday.üß†What Are Session Profiles?A session profile describes the typical price structure and narrative during a market session ‚Äî from open ‚Üí high/low ‚Üí close.In Forex, we focus on:‚Ä¢\tAsian Session‚Ä¢\tLondon Session‚Ä¢\tNew York SessionEach session can act as either a reversal or continuation of the previous session(s).üìàWhy They WorkMarkets are engineered to:‚Ä¢\tRun stops (above highs or below lows)‚Ä¢\tFill inefficiencies (fair value gaps or imbalances)CLS prefer to move price during specific times ‚Äî the active hours around session opens. This is where liquidity is high and slippage is minimal, making it ideal for executing large orders.So, session profiles help us map out when and where these manipulations are most likely to happen.‚úÖWhy You Should Use ThemSession profiles help you:‚Ä¢\tAvoid low-probability trades in dead sessions‚Ä¢\tFocus on high-probability narratives‚Ä¢\tAnchor your execution models to contextBut remember: they are not an entry model. You still need:‚Ä¢\tA higher timeframe bias‚Ä¢\tA mechanical entry model‚Ä¢\tA system for risk and trade managementüîÅHow to Use Session ProfilesUse the previous session(s) to anticipate the next one.‚Ä¢\tFor London session ‚Üí analyze the Asian session‚Ä¢\tFor New York session ‚Üí analyze Asian + London sessionsYou‚Äôre looking for:1.\tManipulations into key levels2.\tDisplacement (price moves away strongly)3.\tChange in order flow (e.g.  OB,on M5 ,15 or H1)4.\tRemaining liquidity targets (draw on liquidity)üìäSession Profile Types with Chart Logic1. üîÑLondon Continuation ProfileConditions:‚Ä¢\tAsia session already made a manipulation into a key level‚Ä¢\tPrice displaced away from that level‚Ä¢\tCIOD / OB on M15 or H1 before London openExample:‚Ä¢\tH1: Asia runs stops above H1 high into a fair value gap (key level)‚Ä¢\tDisplacement confirms intent‚Ä¢\tAt London open, price retraces into M15 premium (PD array) and continues in the same directionInvalidation: the manipulation high/low from Asia sessionNarrative: Asia did the manipulation ‚Üí London does the continuation.2. üîÅLondon Reversal ProfileConditions:‚Ä¢\tAsia session consolidates near a higher timeframe key level‚Ä¢\tLondon open initiates the manipulation into the key level‚Ä¢\tDisplacement + M15 BOS after manipulationExample:‚Ä¢\tH1: Asia consolidates under daily FVG‚Ä¢\tLondon opens, price runs Asia high into that FVG‚Ä¢\tM15 breaks down ‚Üí clean short setup‚Ä¢\tTarget: higher timeframe draw on liquidity (e.g., previous day low)Invalidation: the London session high (manipulation point)Narrative: London performs the manipulation ‚Üí price reverses.3. üîÑNew York Continuation ProfileConditions:‚Ä¢\tAsia + London already created a clear manipulation and displacement‚Ä¢\tLondon has not reached the final draw on liquidity‚Ä¢\tLondon is not overextended (e.g., <70 pips move)‚Ä¢\tNew York opens with structure intact for continuationExample:‚Ä¢\tH1: London makes a reversal from a key level and displaces lower‚Ä¢\tDraw on liquidity (e.g., previous day low) still untouched‚Ä¢\tNY opens and continues the sell-off, retracing briefly into M15 imbalance before expanding lowerInvalidation: manipulation level from LondonNarrative: London set the direction ‚Üí NY finishes the move.4. üîÅNew York Reversal ProfileConditions:‚Ä¢\tNo clear London profile (no key level touched, no strong CHoCH)‚Ä¢\tNY opens and manipulates into a key level (e.g., daily OB, FVG)‚Ä¢\tClear M15 or H1 CHoCH or BOS confirming reversal‚Ä¢\tAsia + London lows still intact (liquidity available below)Example:‚Ä¢\tH1: No strong setup in London‚Ä¢\tNY opens, price spikes into daily OB and takes out London highs‚Ä¢\tM15 structure shifts ‚Üí sell targeting London + Asia lowsInvalidation: NY session manipulation highNarrative: London was noise ‚Üí NY takes control and reverses.üîÅVisual Structure FlowBefore applying any session profile, confirm:1.\tHigh-probability trading conditions (e.g., key level proximity, market open, liquidity available, Red News)2.\tBias in place (HTF (D1 and Weekly direction must be known)Then:‚Üí Check for valid session narrative‚Üí Select the correct session profile‚Üí Wait for the stop run of H1 / H4‚Üí Is there enough room for the move to key level‚Üí If we are still in first half of session you can enter. If its close the end of session skip it.‚Üí Apply your entry and risk model.‚Üí Dont be greedy look for 2:1 RR trade and get out.üîÅ[I]How to enter ?if bearish - You always want enter above H1 I H4 candle after LTF CIODIf bullish - You always want to enter bellow H1/ H4  after LTF CIOD.Use Order block to enter the market here is how to identify it correctlyRemember:Never sell low / Never buy High... wait for stop run / Liquidity sweeps. If you dont know where is the liquidity - you will be liquidity.Hope this brings clarity to your trading.Done on the Tradenation ChartsDisclosure: I am part of Trade Nation's Influencer program and receive a monthly fee for using their TradingView charts in my analysis.\"Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.\"‚Äî David Perk aka Dave FX Hunter ‚öîÔ∏è"

    "content": [
      "This is a classic signal and we are going to be looking at it on two different timeframes, daily and weekly.Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is producing a strong bearish divergence with the RSI. The weekly timeframe is very pronounced and I will show you the details below. This type of signal tends to support a change of trend. It appears before the reversal happens but sometimes it can take years before it goes into effect.¬ª BTC.D Weekly RSIHere you can see the RSI peaked October 2023. Then a lower high October 2024, then again in April 2025 and finally last month.As the RSI produces lower highs BTC.D is producing higher highs.This signal is supported by decreasing volume. Bitcoin Dominance continues to climb higher while trading volume continues to drop. Both signal support a change of trend soon and together they become stronger.¬ª BTC.D Daily RSIThe daily RSI peaked June 2023 but we will focus on the short-term as we already have a strong signal coming from the weekly.Here we have a peak in May 2025 and a strong lower high in June. Needless to say, BTC.D peaked 27-June thus the divergence but the action is clearly weak.¬ª Bitcoin dailyThere is a long-term rising wedge on the weekly timeframe and this pattern can also support a reversal.All these signals are bearish but not very strong, still, there is some weakness on the bearish side for this index. This means that the action can turn bearish tomorrow or it can continue rising for weeks or months before turning red.These signals are pointing to a reversal but they do not give us a specific date. Can happen next week, next month or in seven months. If we focus on the altcoins, the way they are looking and how long will it take for them to grow, then this index can turn bearish within 2-4 weeks. Bitcoin will also grow as the altcoins market grow. Everything Crypto will grow in late 2025.Thanks a lot for your continued support.Namaste.",
      "Bitcoin Dominance index (BTC.D) is on its third red week. This index has not seen 3 red weeks since November 2024.Since the candles are small this time, it means that the drop will be many times stronger and last much longer compared to last year. Instead of three red weeks we can end up with 8 or 6, or more."

Resistance Zone & Downtrend Line:Price was rejected from a resistance block near the EMA 200 (~$3,331) and descending trendline.This level has repeatedly triggered strong downside moves (highlighted with red arrows).2. EMA 200 Reaction:The EMA 200 at $3,331.10 is acting as dynamic resistance.Each time price reaches or crosses above this line, selling pressure increases.3. Bearish Price Projection:After recent rejection, the chart anticipates a pullback to the support zone between $3,248.26 and $3,245.71.A deeper drop toward $3,159.13 is projected as a next major target, consistent with previous price moves.4. RSI Indicator:RSI at 40.24 suggests bearish momentum is still in play but not yet oversold‚Äîindicating room for more downside.---Bearish Trade IdeaElement Level / DescriptionEntry Zone Below resistance: $3,310‚Äì$3,320Target 1 $3,248.26‚Äì$3,245.71 (support zone)Target 2 $3,159.13 (channel base / next support)Stop-Loss Above $3,335 (above resistance zone)---Risk ConsiderationsFundamental catalysts: Gold is sensitive to USD strength, interest rate decisions, and macroeconomic data.Invalidation: A strong breakout and close above the descending trendline and EMA 200 would negate the bearish outlook.---SummaryThis analysis outlines a bearish setup for XAU/USD, supported by trendline resistance, EMA rejection, and RSI momentum.

      "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has been trading sideways, almost flat, since the July 03 High, supported by the 1D MA50 (blue trend-line).Perhaps the strongest development of the week though is the fact that this consolidation has been taking place at the top (Lower Highs) of what we previously identified as a Bull Flag pattern.Together with the 1D MA50, this Lower Highs trend-line forms a formidable Support, which as long as it holds, can technically fulfil the technical expectations out of this pattern and target the 2.0 Fibonacci extension at $168500.Is this one step closer to our 'fair valued' $150k Target for this Cycle?

It previosly closed above the major resistance. Besides that the DXY is still in a up trend since 2011. Look at the bottoms. When it comes to Bitcoin there isn¬¥t enough demand to take it higher. With inflation worries in the US there probably won¬¥t be any cuts on rates in the short term that the crypto community is expecting. It¬¥s likely already priced in the BTC price. Im looking to short it instead. I actually think there is a mania going on since months back with BTC treasury companies entering way to late in the cycle. Im expecting the price to fall like dominoes with margin calls everywhere in the crypto industry. I believe in blockchain and I understand it¬¥s use cases but it not the time to be that speculative right now in my opinion. Always do your own research and yur own descisions. Everyone serves themselves in todays society. This is not a financial advise. Good luck friends (Bulls & Bears)",

    "title": "Just Two Months Left: Navigating Bitcoin and Global Changes",
    "content": [
      "Greetings to everyone reading these lines! Today, I want to share with you not just an analysis, but my personal reflections and feelings about the current situation in the financial and cryptocurrency markets, especially regarding Bitcoin.Many of you already know that I have always been a firm believer in Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycles. Right now, we are approaching the final stage of another such cycle-the distribution phase. The past few months have seen considerable turmoil: Trump's election, escalating conflicts between India and Pakistan, Israel and Iran, rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and not to mention China‚Äôs increasingly assertive geopolitical moves. I can't shake the feeling that the world stands on the threshold of something significant, perhaps serious. I sincerely hope I'm mistaken, but signs of a global conflict or a substantial reset in the world order are undeniably in the air.History shows us that after major upheavals and wars, the world undergoes profound changes. It seems we are nearing such a pivotal moment within the next couple of months. For a long time, I've highlighted September 2025 as a critical point in the current market cycle, and now everything confirms this scenario.In these unstable times, participants in the financial markets face both risks and tremendous opportunities. The distinguishing factor today is the rapid integration of artificial intelligence into all areas of life. I firmly believe that if you don't begin incorporating AI into your activities now, you risk being left behind. Personally, I'm actively integrating artificial intelligence into my professional processes and everyday life, as I see it as inevitable in our near future.Regarding the cryptocurrency market, I'll be frank: the past couple of years have significantly changed it and even somewhat disappointed me. Liquidity has become diluted, and the market has clearly become seasonal, with brief periods of explosive growth followed by long downturns. This has led me to return to trading Forex and gold, where the market is more transparent and predictable.Many crypto projects that seemed promising in 2017 are now nearly forgotten and stagnating. Think of Dash, EOS, Litecoin, ZCash, and others-they haven't disappeared entirely, but they no longer play significant roles in the market. The battle for user attention has become overly aggressive, and competition has devolved into chasing short-lived hype. Nevertheless, there are exceptions, such as Solana‚Äîa project that achieved success thanks to a fortunate combination of factors. Yet such projects remain exceedingly rare.Today, I see the most promising and powerful trend as the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). It doesn‚Äôt matter so much which blockchain will be used-the concept itself has already proven effective. While this journey won't be easy, the involvement of giants like BlackRock indicates the trend is sustainable and promising in the long run.Overall, I am confident that financial markets and digital currencies will continue to evolve and grow. However, in about two months, I plan to adopt a bearish stance. Unfortunately, there are few signs of a quick global economic recovery. The world needs significant restructuring and changes-new rules and agreements are inevitable, and the coming year promises many notable events.Ask yourself: Are you ready for these changes? Are you prepared to adapt to new conditions, technologies, and realities? Personally, I'm fully ready, which is why I remain active in the market, continuing to share my thoughts, assist, and engage with each of you. If you have questions, ideas, or proposals for collaboration, I am always open to dialogue and eager for any interaction.I sincerely thank each of you for your support, comments, and attention to my posts. I stay here because I believe in the enormous opportunities available even in the most uncertain times. We have an exciting journey ahead, and I invite you to travel it together with me.Wishing you success, profits, and above all, peace and kindness on our planet. The time of change is already here. Let‚Äôs meet it together.Warm regards,Your EXCAVO."

    "content": [
      "EURUSD is currently trading within a clear descending channel after rejecting a key resistance area. This move signals a shift in short-term sentiment, with bearish momentum guiding price action lower. The channel structure is intact, and as long as price respects this slope, lower levels remain in play.Rejection From ResistanceAfter tapping into the major resistance zone, price failed to break higher and began forming lower highs and lower lows, confirming seller control. The rejection was clean and initiated the current bearish structure, which now serves as a roadmap for potential continuation lower.Imbalance and Downside TargetsBelow current price, there‚Äôs a visible imbalance that remains unfilled within the highlighted purple zone. This area acts as a magnet for price, especially if the bearish structure continues. A drop into this zone would align with a textbook move to fill inefficiency before a potential reversal can occur.Support Structure and Liquidity ZoneThere‚Äôs a strong support level marked just above the imbalance, which may offer a temporary reaction or even serve as a springboard for a reversal. This is also a likely liquidity pool, and a sweep of these lows could generate the fuel needed for a bullish move back toward mid-channel or even higher.Projection and ScenariosPrice may either continue respecting the channel boundaries with stair-step retracements down into the imbalance, or break structure early with a more aggressive reversal once the inefficiency is filled. A deeper move into the purple zone followed by a reaction would suggest a potential shift in momentum.ConclusionThe pair remains in a bearish corrective phase for now, with room to dip further into the unmitigated imbalance. Watch for how price reacts at support and whether a clean sweep and reversal setup presents itself. Until then, the channel remains the dominant structure guiding this move.Disclosure: I am part of Trade Nation's Influencer program and receive a monthly fee for using their TradingView charts in my analysis.___________________________________Thanks for your support!If you found this idea helpful or learned something new, drop a like üëç and leave a comment, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! üöÄ",

      "XAUUSDis under pressure from the rising dollar and uncertainty, breaking through support levels, which opens up a corridor for the market to fall to 3255 - 3246The price of gold is consolidating around $3300 after falling more than 1% amid expectations of the Fed minutes and news about tariffs.Investors remain cautious: the dollar is supported by hopes for US trade deals, while the threat of new tariffs from August 1 is holding back gold's growth.Weak inflation data in China did not support the metal, while expectations that the Fed will not rush to cut rates due to inflationary pressure from tariffs are also limiting interest in gold. Traders are waiting for the Fed minutes and new statements from Trump to determine the further direction.Technically, the market looks weak (on D1, the price closed below the key level of 3300 on Tuesday) and there is a chance of a further decline.Resistance levels: 3300, 3311Support levels: 3295, 3255, 3246Consolidation below 3295-3300 could trigger a further decline to 3255, from which the market could react with a correction.Buying can be considered if gold reverses the short scenario, manages to strengthen to 3311, and consolidates above this level. At the moment, the price is in the selling zone...Best regards, R. Linda!"

    "title": "Why Traders Freeze: The Psychology Behind Not Cutting Losses",
    "content": [
      "First up: let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room. Loss aversion ‚Äî that great human flaw. From the moment your ancient ancestor decided to poke a saber-toothed tiger to see what happens, the brain has been hard-coded to avoid pain at all costs.Loss aversion is literally in your DNA ‚Äî studies show people feel the sting of a loss twice as intensely as the pleasure of an equivalent gain.When you see that trade slip into the red, your rational brain may say, ‚ÄúCut it, the setup is invalid, live to trade another day.‚Äù But your emotional brain ‚Äî the one still grunting in a cave ‚Äî is screaming, ‚ÄúIt might come back! Hold! HOOOLD!‚Äù So you sit, frozen.üå±Hope: The Most Expensive Four-Letter WordHope is the silent killer of trading accounts. You think you‚Äôre being patient as you decide to give the trade ‚Äúroom to breathe.‚ÄùBut what you‚Äôre really doing is outsourcing your exit strategy to technical tools, news headlines, and anything that‚Äôs not your own choice, hoping something will rescue your losing position.This is how tiny losses can turn into portfolio ruin. Just ask anyone who‚Äôs held a small-cap memecoin down 90% because the ‚Äúteam has potential.‚ÄùüßäAnalysis Paralysis: When the Chart Becomes a MazeAnother reason traders freeze? Overanalysis. One bad candle and suddenly you‚Äôre toggling between the 1-minute, 5-minute, and daily chart like you‚Äôre hacking into the Pentagon. And your trendlines? You‚Äôre probablydrawing them wrong.More data rarely leads to more decisive action. It just feeds your brain conflicting signals until you‚Äôre convinced you see a bounce that isn‚Äôt there. Meanwhile, the loss grows. And grows. And then you‚Äôre back to hope. Rinse, repeat.üò¨The Ego Monster: Admitting You‚Äôre WrongHere‚Äôs the harsh truth: cutting a loss means admitting you were wrong. For traders, whose entire identity can hinge on being ‚Äúsmart money,‚Äù that feels like public humiliation. The ego monster wants you to be right more than it wants you to be profitable.So instead of taking the small L, you‚Äôll cling to the trade because closing it out would force you to look in the mirror and say, ‚ÄúI was wrong and I need to do better.‚Äùüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èFrom Risk Management to Revenge TradingOnce you‚Äôve frozen long enough, you reach the next stage of the bad-losing cycle:revenge trading. Now you‚Äôre not just trying to recover your loss; you‚Äôre out to punish the market for ‚Äútaking‚Äù your money.Spoiler alert: the market doesn‚Äôt know you exist, and it certainly doesn‚Äôt care. Maybe this is the gambler‚Äôs mindset disguised as a ‚Äústrategy?‚ÄùüìâBlame the Tools? Not So FastSome traders love to blame outside factors like theEconomic calendaror their indicators when they freeze. ‚ÄúMy RSI didn‚Äôt signal this! The MACD betrayed me!‚Äù Indicators are just tools ‚Äî they don‚Äôt make decisions for you. You do.Hiding behind tools means you refuse to take accountability. It‚Äôs a convenient excuse that can keep you stuck in the same losing habits. Better to master the one tool that matters:your discipline.‚úÇÔ∏èThe Beauty of the Hard StopAll hail the hard stop ‚Äî the trader‚Äôs seatbelt. It‚Äôs not attractive, it‚Äôs mechanical, but it‚Äôs often the only thing standing between you and a potentially blown-up account.The reason some traders can survive the market for decades isn‚Äôt because they‚Äôre never wrong ‚Äî it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve learned to make their stops non-negotiable.A stop-loss is you telling your brain, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not smarter than the market, so I‚Äôll automate the decision before I get emotional.‚Äù It takes the agony out of cutting a loss because you‚Äôve already decided on the outcome before your lizard brain can intervene.‚öñÔ∏èSmall Losses Are the Cost of Doing BusinessWant to feel better about cutting that loss? Think of it as your tuition fee. Every trader pays a certain cost to the market ‚Äî it‚Äôs the cost of playing the game. No one gets every trade right. The pros just get better at losing small.Those big-shot money spinners you look up to? They didn‚Äôt build their empire by never losing. They‚Äôre pros at getting out when they‚Äôre wrong. The difference between a pro and a blow-up isn‚Äôt the winning trade ‚Äî it‚Äôs the ruthless discipline on the losing ones.üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èFinding Comfort in DiscomfortThere‚Äôs no magic trick to make loss-cutting feel good. It always stings. But you can train your brain to see a small loss as a win for your long-term survival. Write it down.Journal the trade. Log the emotion. Over time you‚Äôll realize that the trades you exit early rarely haunt you.üèÅFace the Fear, Keep the AccountAnd finally, freezing in front of a loss doesn‚Äôt protect you ‚Äî it likely means you‚Äôll pay more than you should. Next time your gut says, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôll come back‚Ä¶‚Äù ask yourself: ‚ÄúDo I want to be right, or do I want to trade another day?‚ÄùYour job is to trade well and stay in the game for as long as possible.Your turn, traders: what‚Äôs your biggest ‚Äúshould‚Äôve cut it sooner‚Äù horror story? Drop it below ‚Äî we promise not to say we told you so."

The classic stop-loss is 8% and market makers know this and manipulate the pricing to scoop up cheap shares before driving the price back up for quick profits.  So unless you‚Äôre a day-trader one needs to understand what‚Äôs driving volatility: News? Trump‚Äôs BS? Economic shocks? War in the middle east? Earnings report? What?  Long-term investors need to differentiate between news shocks and market manipulation versus shifts in big money institution‚Äôs actions. Is this easy? NO!!!!",

      "GBPCHF recently descended with strength, and I‚Äôve been watching to see how price reacts here.Price now hovers above and this is a great indication for us to use for possible continuation move, that could send priceinto the 1.0770 level.But if price breaks above with momentum, then I‚Äôll back off the bearish bias and reassess, and I‚Äôd consider the continuation idea invalidated, with potential for further upside.Just sharing my thoughts for the charts, this isn‚Äôt financial advice.

      "You‚Äôve probably heard that quantum computing could break Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption‚Äîand that‚Äôs true. But here‚Äôs the thing: Bitcoin might not even be the biggest target.The real risks? Financial systems, national security, healthcare, and even the internet itself. These areas rely on the same encryption methods that quantum computers could crack, and the fallout could be far worse than a Bitcoin hack.Let‚Äôs break it down.1Ô∏è‚É£ Financial Systems: A Global Crisis Waiting to HappenImagine if hackers could:Drain bank accounts at will.Manipulate stock markets.Fake trillion-dollar transactions.This isn‚Äôt just about stolen crypto‚Äîit‚Äôs about economic chaos. Banks, stock exchanges, and payment systems all depend on encryption. If quantum computers break it, we‚Äôre looking at a meltdown way bigger than Bitcoin‚Äôs $3 trillion market.2Ô∏è‚É£ National Security & Internet Privacy: A Hacker‚Äôs DreamGovernments and militaries use encryption to:Protect classified intelligence.Secure communications between leaders.Guard critical infrastructure (power grids, water supplies).If quantum computers crack these codes, entire nations could be exposed to cyberwarfare. Your private data? At risk too‚Äîemail, messaging, even your online banking could be decrypted years later.3Ô∏è‚É£ Healthcare, Supply Chains & IoT: The Hidden VulnerabilitiesMedical records could be leaked, exposing sensitive health data.Smart devices (like home security systems) could be hacked.Supply chains might collapse if logistics networks are breached.These systems weren‚Äôt built with quantum threats in mind‚Äîand upgrading them won‚Äôt be easy.üî¥The Bigger Picture: A \"Civilizational Upgrade\"Switching to quantum-resistant encryption is like rebuilding the internet‚Äôs foundation. It‚Äôs necessary, but messy. Some experts compare it to the Y2K bug‚Äîbut way harder.üî∑So, Is Bitcoin Safe?Not entirely‚Äîabout 25% of all Bitcoin could be stolen if quantum computers advance fast enough. But compared to the risks facing banks, governments, and hospitals? Bitcoin might be the least of our worries.üî∑What‚Äôs Next?Governments & companies are already working on fixes (like NIST‚Äôs post-quantum cryptography standards).The transition will take years‚Äîand hackers might exploit weak spots along the way.Staying informed is key. If you‚Äôre in tech, finance, or security, this affects you.‚ÑπÔ∏èWant to Dive Deeper?Deloitte‚Äôs take on quantum computing & BitcoinForbes on quantum risks beyond cryptoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bottom line?Quantum computing is coming‚Äîand while Bitcoin has risks,the real danger lies in the systems we all depend on every day.‚ùîWhat do you think?

        "text": "@SwallowAcademy, Research indicates that only about 25% of Bitcoin (about 4M BTC) is vulnerable to quantum computing attacks because this portion is stored in specific address types where the public key is exposed. These include Pay to Public Key (p2pk) addresses, mainly from early Bitcoin usage, and reused Pay to Public Key Hash (p2pkh) addresses, where the public key becomes visible after the first transaction. A quantum computer could potentially use advanced algorithms to derive the private key from these public keys, allowing attackers to steal funds.\nThe majority of Bitcoin, stored in unused p2pkh addresses, is not currently at risk because their public keys are not publicly known. However, there is some uncertainty about whether all Bitcoin could become vulnerable during transactions, depending on future quantum computing advancements and mitigation strategies.\nAnd yes, I agree, quantum computing is a systemic risk that can potentially affect the entire online world, that's exactly what I outlined in this article.",

      "Hey Everyone,Absolutely beautiful to see our 1h chart idea playing out perfectly. After completing the bearish targets earlier this week, we had the ema5 cross and lock below 3306 opening the swing range.- This played out perfectly hitting the first swing range level and doing exactly what it say son the tin giving the full swing into 3306 just like we highlighted.We will now look for ema5 lock above 3306 for a continuation into the bullish targets above or failure to lock will see rejections into the lower Goldturns for suport and bounce.If it continues to fail breakout above, into the first Bullish target, then we are likely to see the full swing range tested on the rejections.We will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch bounces up.We will continue to buy dips using our support levels taking 20 to 40 pips. As stated before each of our level structures give 20 to 40 pip bounces, which is enough for a nice entry and exit. If you back test the levels we shared every week for the past 24 months, you can see how effectively they were used to trade with or against short/mid term swings and trends.The swing range give bigger bounces then our weighted levels that's the difference between weighted levels and swing ranges.BULLISH TARGET3358EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3358 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGETS3389EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3389 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET3416EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 3416 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET3439BEARISH TARGETS3330 - DONEEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 3330 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BEARISH TARGET3306 - DONEEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 3306 WILL OPEN THE SWING RANGE3283 - DONE3254As always, we will keep you all updated with regular updates throughout the week and how we manage the active ideas and setups.

    "title": "Bitcoin - Liquidity grab at $111.000?",
    "content": [
      "This 4-hour BTCUSD chart illustrates a potential short-term bullish continuation scenario followed by a deeper retracement, highlighting key liquidity levels and an important Fair Value Gap (FVG) support zone.Liquidity sweepAt the top of the current price action, just above the $110,612.16 level, there is a clear area of resting liquidity. This zone has likely accumulated a significant number of stop-loss orders from traders who are shorting the market or who went long earlier and are protecting profits below previous highs. The market tends to seek liquidity to fill institutional orders, making this zone a high-probability target for a sweep. As a result, price is likely to take out these resting stop orders in a quick upward move, often referred to as a \"liquidity grab\" or \"stop hunt\", before potentially reversing or consolidating.Bullish 4H FVGFollowing this liquidity sweep, the chart suggests a retracement into a bullish 4-hour Fair Value Gap (FVG) located around the $106,600 to $107,400 region. This imbalance zone was formed during an impulsive move up, leaving behind a gap between the wicks of consecutive candles. Such gaps represent areas where demand previously overwhelmed supply, and they often act as strong support on a retest. If price revisits this zone, it is expected to offer support and could serve as a base for another upward push, assuming bullish momentum remains intact.Downside riskHowever, if the bullish FVG fails to hold as support and price breaks down through this imbalance zone, it would signal a weakening of bullish structure. In that case, the breakdown would likely lead to a deeper correction or even a trend reversal, with price seeking lower levels of support further down the chart. This would invalidate the short-term bullish scenario and suggest that sellers are gaining control, possibly triggering further liquidations and more aggressive selling pressure.ConclusionOverall, the chart is currently leaning bullish, anticipating a liquidity sweep to the upside followed by a potential pullback into the FVG. The reaction at the FVG will be critical in determining whether the market can continue higher or if it shifts into a deeper bearish correction.Disclosure: I am part of Trade Nation's Influencer program and receive a monthly fee for using their TradingView charts in my analysis.Thanks for your support.- Make sure to follow me so you don't miss out on the next analysis!- Drop a like and leave a comment!",
